[Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) is an industry-leading optimization solver. [`gurobipy`](https://pypi.org/project/gurobipy/) is its Python interface, which enables you to call Gurobi solvers from Python. You will use both these tools in RSM8423 (Optimizing Supply Chain Management and Logistics). This guide aims to get you started with Gurobi via `gurobypy`.

### Installation

Follow the steps below to install Gurobi and `gurobipy`. As a side note, the`gurobipy` package itself ships with a size-limited Gurobi trial license which can solve models with up to 2000 variables and 2000 constraints. Therefore, you could skip the step 1 below if the optimization problems you plan to solve are within the limit. 

1. Follow a 5-step instruction [here](https://www.gurobi.com/features/academic-named-user-license/) to download and install the Gurobi Optimizer (version 10 with Academic Named-User License).

    **Important:** To activate the academic license (step 5), your computer must be connected to the UofT network.

2. Install the `gurobipy` package. You could simply use `pip`.

    ```
    pip install gurobipy
    ```

    Alternatively, if you use the Anaconda Python distribution, and are familiar with `conda`, you could use the `conda` command line (the `-c` option specifies the `gurobi` channel). 

    ```
    conda install -c gurobi gurobi

    ```
3. Download and run this simple example ([mip.py](mip.py)) to verify your installation.

### An Example

* Solve a MIP problem ( [![](colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tdmdal/gurobi-guide/blob/master/docs/mip.ipynb) )

    This Python notebook walks you through the steps to formulate and solve a simple MIP (Mixed-Integer Programming) problem. This is the same [example](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/10.0/quickstart_windows/cs_example_mip1_py.html) as in Gurobi's official document.
